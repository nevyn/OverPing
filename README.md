# OverPing

OverPing lets you continuously monitor the performance of your Internet connection. This is useful if you're on unreliable wifi or Hotspotting while travelling, as it lets you tell at a glance whether your current connectivity problems are your connection's fault or not.

For example, I keep this running while on the train and doing a Hangout or Slack voice chat. When the other side cuts out, I can look at the bars: if they're green, it's their connection that sucks; if they're not green, it's my connection.

Before OverPing, I would always have a Terminal window open on every desktop just doing `ping 8.8.8.8`. OverPing does this, but on every desktop, and with a pretty, animated bar graph. Each pixel represents one millisecond of delay in getting information to and from Internet.
